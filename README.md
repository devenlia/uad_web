# UAD - Unified Application Directory

Welcome to UAD (Unified Application Directory)! This promising project, currently in development, is designed to streamline the way businesses and organizations manage their numerous links, particularly where there are many web applications in use, such as vCenter Firewall and others. Focused on productivity and efficiency, UAD keeps all your necessary links categorized and centralized!

## What is UAD?

Unified Application Directory (UAD) is a unique solution to manage the clutter of links that come with using multiple web applications. It categorizes and stores links, providing a centralised hub, thereby offering a smooth navigation experience. Developed with modern technologies, UAD is both robust and user-friendly.
